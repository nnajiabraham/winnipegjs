          <p>
            We are a group of passionate Javascript developers practicing our
            craft in the cold, frozen wonders of Winnipeg. We love the web,
            sharing our knowledge with others and learning new things from one
            another. So don't be shy, stop by one of our meetups we would &lt;3
            to have you there.

          <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the
            world. It started as a simple way to validate data entered on web
            forms. It since has grown to be the scripting language of choice not
            just for the web, but for many software platforms ranging from pdfs
            to servers (with Node.js) and even databases (like MongoDB). The
            expressive nature of the language, its simplicity and light weight
            were a big factor in its popularity.

          <h2>Join us</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript was born as a web language. The web is all about sharing
            and a strong community. We like to build upon that tradition and
            help one another build better applications. Of course, we cannot do
            that without your help! We need you to come to our meetups, present,
            share, teach and learn.
